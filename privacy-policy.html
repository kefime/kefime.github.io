    <h1>Kefi App Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 30, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Kefi is a communication platform that integrates with your Gmail account via the Gmail API to send and read emails on your behalf. This functionality is intended to streamline your communication processes and enhance your productivity.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Access</h2>
    <p>
        To provide our core services, Kefi requests access to your Gmail account through Google's secure OAuth 2.0 authorization process. This includes permissions to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Read your emails</li>
        <li>Send emails on your behalf</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. No Data Storage or Logging</h2>
    <p>
        Kefi does not store, log, or retain any of your personal information or email content. All operations performed via the Gmail API are transient and are used solely to execute the requested actions in real time.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We use secure industry-standard practices and Google's OAuth 2.0 protocol to ensure your data is never accessed or used outside the intended scope. Your trust and privacy are of utmost importance to us.
    </p>

    <h2>5. User Consent</h2>
    <p>
        Access to your Gmail data is granted only with your explicit consent through the Google authorization process. You can revoke access at any time from your Google account settings.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Any changes to this privacy policy will be posted on our official website. We encourage users to review this policy periodically.
    </p>
